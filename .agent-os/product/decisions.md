## 2025-08-08: Foundation Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Community

### Decision

Chezmakase will be built on top of chezmoi as the core configuration management system, maintaining the existing multi-phase installation architecture (bootstrap → installers → configurations) while adding generic templating and cross-platform compatibility.

### Context

The existing personal dotfiles system has proven effective for managing development environments across multiple machines and platforms. The system uses chezmoi's templating capabilities for conditional configuration and has a well-organized phase-based installation process.

### Rationale

- **Proven Foundation**: The current architecture has been battle-tested in real-world usage
- **Cross-Platform Native**: chezmoi already provides excellent cross-platform support
- **Template Power**: Go templating allows sophisticated conditional logic
- **Community Momentum**: chezmoi has strong community adoption and active development

## 2025-08-08: Target Platform Strategy

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Community

### Decision

Primary platform support will target major Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch), with explicit container environment detection and adaptation. macOS and Windows support are deferred to future phases.

### Context

Cross-distribution compatibility is a key differentiator from Ubuntu-specific solutions like Omakub. The existing system is designed to handle multiple Linux distributions effectively.

### Rationale

- **Market Demand**: Many developers work across different Linux distributions
- **Technical Feasibility**: Current codebase already supports these platforms
- **Resource Focus**: Concentrating on two platform families allows better quality
- **Container Compatibility**: Modern development increasingly uses containerized environments

## 2025-08-08: Installation Philosophy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** User Experience
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Community

### Decision

Maintain the "one-command installation" approach with optional component selection, following the proven chezmoi initialization pattern while adding Chezmakase-specific configuration prompts.

### Context

Users expect simple, reliable installation processes. The existing chezmoi integration provides a solid foundation that users in the chezmoi community already understand.

### Rationale

- **User Familiarity**: chezmoi users already understand the initialization process
- **Reliability**: Leverages chezmoi's proven installation and error handling
- **Flexibility**: Allows customization without complexity
- **Consistency**: Maintains chezmoi conventions and best practices

## 2025-08-08: Customization Strategy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Community

### Decision

Implement a layered customization approach: core templates with user overrides, community plugins, and organization-specific profiles. Avoid creating a complex configuration DSL.

### Context

Users need flexibility to adapt Chezmakase to their specific needs without losing the benefits of a curated, maintained distribution.

### Rationale

- **Simplicity**: Avoid over-engineering with complex configuration systems
- **Maintainability**: Keep the core system focused and stable
- **Community Growth**: Enable community contributions without architectural complexity
- **Migration Path**: Easy to adopt initially and customize progressively

## 2025-08-08: Editor Integration Approach

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, User Community

### Decision

Provide opinionated configurations for Neovim (LazyVim), Cursor, and VS Code, with clear paths for users to override or disable any editor setup. Maintain editor configs as symlinked modules rather than inline templates.

### Context

Editor choice is highly personal, but many users benefit from curated, working configurations. The current symlink approach allows sharing configurations between the dotfiles system and direct editor access.

### Rationale

- **Flexibility**: Users can opt out of any editor configuration
- **Maintainability**: Symlinked configs are easier to develop and test
- **Community Standards**: LazyVim, Cursor, and VS Code represent popular, well-supported choices
- **Development Efficiency**: Shared configurations between dotfiles and direct editor usage
