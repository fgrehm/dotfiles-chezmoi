# Chezmakase Mission (Lite)

A cross-platform, chezmoi-powered dotfiles distribution that gives developers a
complete development environment setup in one command - working seamlessly
across Linux distributions, unlike platform-specific solutions like Ubuntu-only Omakub.

The only dotfiles solution that combines the power of chezmoi's templating
with curated, battle-tested configurations for a professional development
setup that adapts to your system automatically.
