  - [ ] 6.5 Update installation instructions with configuration options
  - [ ] 6.6 Validate all documentation is accurate and complete

## Radar

- What is the best framework for shell testing these days? Anything that helps interactions with docker / chezmakase?
- **User Customization Strategy**: How should users fork/customize chezmakase? Consider:
  - Template repository approach vs fork-and-customize
  - Namespace/branding (chezmakase framework vs user's dotfiles-chezmakase)
  - Configuration inheritance and overrides
  - Update mechanism when base framework evolves
