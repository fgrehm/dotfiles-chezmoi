# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Chezmakase Improvements
> Created: 2025-08-08

## Overview

Improve chezmakase dotfiles system by ensuring devcontainer compatibility, implementing
optional component configuration, and addressing existing TODO items. This will prepare the
system for broader distribution while maintaining functionality across different environments.

## User Stories

### Devcontainer User Story

As a developer working in devcontainers, I want chezmakase to work seamlessly in my
containerized environment, so that I can maintain consistent development setups regardless
of whether I'm on bare metal or containers.

The system should detect container environments and skip or adapt components that don't work
in containers (like desktop applications, system-level configurations) while preserving core
development tools.

### Customization User Story

As a new chezmakase user, I want to choose which components to install during setup, so that
I don't get tools I don't need and can customize my environment to my preferences.

The system should provide clear options for major components (editors, docker services,
desktop apps) with sensible defaults while allowing opt-out.

### Maintainer User Story

As a chezmakase maintainer, I want all existing TODOs resolved, so that the codebase is
clean and the roadmap reflects actual planned work rather than scattered TODO comments.

## Spec Scope

1. **Devcontainer Compatibility Audit** - Test and fix all installation phases in
   devcontainer environments
2. **Optional Components System** - Design and implement configuration for optional installations  
3. **TODO Resolution** - Address all existing TODO items in codebase systematically
4. **Testing Infrastructure** - Create testing approach for both devcontainer and bare metal
   scenarios
5. **Documentation Updates** - Update installation docs to reflect new optional components

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of installation system
- New major features beyond existing TODOs
- Cross-platform testing (focus on Linux devcontainers first)
- GUI configuration interface

## Expected Deliverable

1. Chezmakase installs and functions correctly in devcontainer environments
2. Users can configure which major components to install via configuration system
3. All existing TODO items are either implemented or moved to proper issue tracking
