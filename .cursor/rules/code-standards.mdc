# Code Standards

## General Principles

- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary for the goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) unless explicitly requested
- Follow existing patterns and conventions found in the codebase

## Shell Script Standards

- All scripts must start with `set -eo pipefail`
- Use proper error handling throughout scripts
- Include meaningful comments for complex operations
- Follow the existing script naming conventions

## Markdown Standards

- Maximum 100 characters per line (configured in `.markdownlint.json`)
- All markdown files must end with exactly one newline character (MD047)
- Wrap lines at 100 characters for readability and linting compliance

## File Organization

- Installation scripts use phase-based organization:
  - `00-bootstrap/` - System-level setup
  - `01-installers/` - Application installations
  - `02-configurations/` - Configuration application
- Configuration files in `configs/` are symlinked to avoid duplication
- Template files (`.tmpl`) support conditional logic based on system detection

## Testing and Validation

- Use `chezmoi diff` to preview changes before applying
- Test installation scripts in isolated environments when possible
- Validate template syntax before committing changes
